\section*{2's Complement Number System}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The sign of a 2's Complement number is indicated by the MSB.
    \item A 4-bit 2's Complement number has a range from -8 to +7.
    \item Anything outside this range is considered an overflow.
    \item Overflow is not indicated by Cout (CO) for signed values.
    \item If you add two positive numbers and get a negative as output, or two negative numbers and get a positive, you must have produced a result greater than 7 or less than -8.
