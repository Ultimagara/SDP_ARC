Recall that the sign of a 2’s Complement number is indicated by the MSB. A 4-bit 2’s Complement number can only account for values between -8 and +7. Anything outside this range is considered an overflow. Overflow is not indicated by Cout (CO) for signed values. Instead, recognize that if you add two positive numbers and get a negative as output, or two negative numbers and get a positive, you must have produced a result greater than 7 or less than -8.
